# Introduction
This post aims to quicky bring together some resources for quick wins to get cobalt beacons.

## Not reinventing the wheel

The below Sophos post does such a great job at explaining the process.

## TLDR Quick Winds

Check your base64 against this cheatsheet ![base64 cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/Neo23x0/6af876ee72b51676c82a2db8d2cd3639)

Some beacons like to use a %COMSPEC% service with encoded powershell that looks something like 
`%COMSPEC% /b /c start /b /min powershell -nop -w hidden -encodedcommand <Base64Here>`

Plugging this into cyberchef with the following recipie should show the next stage of the config
![Recipie1](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Base64('A-Za-z0-9%2B/%3D',true)Remove_null_bytes())

In the case there is some more obfuscation here, and it is compressed try the following recipie

![Recipe2](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Base64('A-Za-z0-9%2B/%3D',true)Gunzip())

Now you should see the config with a `$DoIt = @` at the top after Set-StrictMode version 2

Scrolling down, you may see `[Byte[]]$var_code = <another base64 string>`

Copy out this base64 string and place into this recipie (Take note of the `bxor <number>` below the base64 command, this contains the decimal xor string you might need)

![recipie3](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Base64('A-Za-z0-9%2B/%3D',true)XOR(%7B'option':'Decimal','string':'35'%7D,'Standard',false))

This will output the beacon config, where you can see either a URL or a Named Pipe, if you save this file (Windows Defender will block it) as a .bin file you can use ![scdbg](http://sandsprite.com/CodeStuff/scdbg.zip) to see the windows API Cals

`scdbg /f download.bin`
