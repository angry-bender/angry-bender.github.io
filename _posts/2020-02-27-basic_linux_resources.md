# Introduction
These resources Have been provided for a  Linux course I have had to instruct. It contains a command cheat sheet & posts that will help basic analysts be able use and research how to use Linux.

# Bash keyboard commands

The mouse won’t work, use the left/right arrow keys to move around the line.

When the cursor is where you want it in the line, typing inserts text – i.e. it doesn’t always over-type what’s already there.

[*Back to table of contents*](#)

## Moving Cursor

**Ctrl + A** or Home	Moves the cursor to the Start of a line.

**Ctrl + E** or End		Moves the cursor to the End of a line.

**ESC + B**			Moves to the Beginning of the previous or current word.

**Ctrl + K**			Deletes form the current cursor position to the end of the line.

**Ctrl + U**			Deletes from the start of the line to the current cursor position.

**Ctrl + W**		Deletes the WORD before the cursor.

**ALT + B**			Moves Back one word at a time

**ALT + F**			Moves Forward one word at a time

**ALT + C**		capitalises letter where cursor is and moves to end of word


[*Back to table of contents*](#)

## Exiting a running command or accessing another command window

**Ctrl + C**			Kills the current Process

**Ctrl + Alt + F1-6**		Changes terminals (Up to 6)

**Ctrl + Z**		Suspends the current process (Can be bought back by typing fg)


[*Back to table of contents*](#)

## Search for text in a file (less, more)

**/pattern**		Searches forward n for next N for previous

### Creating a profile for Systemd-networkd (networkd)
  
#### See also https://man.archlinux.org/man/systemd.netdev.5.en OR `man netdev`

1. Review your interfaces with `networkctl`
2. Review any existing configuration files under cat /etc/systemd/network/*
3. If, there are exisiting configuration files, such as a file that contains 
  
  ```
  [Match]
  Name=e*
  
  [Network]
  DHCP=true
  ```
  
  This means any interface starting with e will be configured for DHCP, if this is desired, leave it as is.
  
  if you'd like a static IP, remove any file similar to above and create one as per the example below
  
  ```
  [Match]
  Name=ens133
  
  [Network]
  Address=192.168.1.2
  Gateway=192.168.0.1
  ```
  
4. Save the file then ensure it has the correct security with `chmod 644 <filename>`
5. Restart the service with `systemctl restart systemd-networkd`

then, after using an awk, or any method of reducing data down to a single character, pipe it to forensicate, and get your quick wins

![forensicate](/img/lt/forensicate.png)

[*Back to table of contents*](#)

## Grep

### Introduction & Description

Grep is a Linux users "Swiss Army knife" of searching for strings or patterns, think of it like your find button in notepad, but on steroids. It works by scanning each line of text in a steam or file, searching it for your pattern, then printing it to the terminal.

![grepcomic](/img/lt/grepcomic.jpg)

### Working example

Using [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angry-bender/linuxtraining/master/access.log) example, we might only want to limit our results to POST requests (Where the client has upload something to the web server). This is useful, as it enables us to quickly search a file, for where a malicious script might have been uploaded from our client.

In this case, we have reduced the analyst's work, by reducing a file of over 1000 lines to 58, a much easier bit of data to sort through.



![grep](/img/lt/grep.png)


>Note -  **WSL USERS** : If you are using Windows Subshell for Linux (WSL) you must edit any input file (Files you want to use with -f) within WSL (Use Nano or VIM). Using windows notepad will not work, due to the way it encodes.

Command | Description
-------|--------
`grep “boo” <filename>`	| Standard GREP
`grep –n “boo” <filename>`| 	Prints a line number where the value is present
`grep –vn “boo” <filename>`| 	opposite of the expression you’ve entered
`grep –c “boo” <filename>`| 	prints how many times <string> is present
`grep –l “boo” *`|	prints filenames that contain boo
`grep –i  “BOO”  <filename>`|	ignores case
`grep –x “boo”  <filename>`| Exact Matches
`grep –A2 “aara” <filename>`|	Prints extra lines for Context
`grep –E “e$” <filename>`| Use a Regular expression 
`grep -rail -f <sourcefile>` | Recursively list every file that contains a value from a source file
`grep -raih -f <sourcefile>` | Recursively list every file and string that contains a value from a source file
`grep -raiH -f <sourcefile>` | Recursively list string that contains a value from a source file
`egrep ‘<pattern1>|<pattern2>’ <filename>`| enhanced grep to search for two patterns simultaneously

[*Back to table of contents*](#)

## Sed

### Introduction & Description

Sed, is a command that is used to search and replace a string from a stream or file, without having to open it in a text editor. Think of it like the function in Microsoft word, where you have used replace to fix every instance of a typo you might have done. Similar to grep, it works by searching each line in a file for your pattern, and replaces it with something you have typed.

![sedcomic](/img/lt/sedcomic.jpg)

### Working example

Within forensics, I have normally used this command to replace whitespace, or spaces with comma's so we can convert it into a .csv file, to read in excel. Using [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angry-bender/linuxtraining/master/access.log) as an example.

![sed](/img/lt/sed.png)

Command | Description
-------|--------
`sed -e ‘s/<search>/<replace>/’ <filename>` |	Searches for <search> and replaces the first instance with <replace> on each line
`sed -e ‘s/<search>/<replace>/2’ <filename>` |	Searches for <search> and replaces the second instance with <replace> on each line
`sed -e ‘1s/<search>/<replace>/1’ <filename>` | Searches for and replaces on a single line
`sed -e ‘1,4s/<search>/<replace>/1’ <filename>` | Searches for and replaces on the first 4 lines
`sed -e ‘s/<search>/<replace>/g’ <filename>` |	Replaces every instance of <search> for with <replace> Globally
`sed -i -e  ‘s/<search>/<replace>/g’ <filename>` |	edits and existing file and replaces the string
`sed -e ‘s/[0-9]*/(&)/’ <filename>` |	Replaces ([0-9]) for a number of any length (*) and inserts a Bracket around them (&)
`sed -e ‘/s/\/etc/\/etc\/ssh\/sshd_conf/’` | <filename>	Replaces /etc/ with /etc/ssh/sshd.conf

[*Back to table of contents*](#)

## Awk

### Introduction & Description

Awk itself is a command that uses its own language to conduct processing and scanning on text, with a number of pre-defined patterns. These patterns scan a input file, or steam and splits each line into a set of fields, that we can manipulate or sort through.

Within a forensics context I have personally not seen these features used. Mainly for Forensics, I have seen it used to sort columns.

![awkcomic](https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--YxKHSWq2--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DeLcVfSWAAAw6OZ.jpg)

### Working example

Using [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/angry-bender/linuxtraining/master/access.log) example, we can see a lot of data present, that might be hard to read. Or, might need to be piped into another command like a GREP. To make analysis easier, we can reduce the file to just the relevant columns that we need. Do do this, you will need to count each of the columns by hand, and use the corresponding number in the `$<number>` within the `print` argument. Each column should be separated with a `,`. See the below example

![awk](/img/lt/Awk.png)

Command | Description
-------|--------
`awk [OPTIONS] filename`	|Pattern scanning and text processing
`awk -f <awkfile> filename` |	Allows the use of an awk file for processing
`awk ‘{print $3}’` |	prints all the 3’rd arguments in a file

## Regex Reference

### A nice way to test your regex before using it

<https://regexr.com/>

<https://regex101.com/>

### Email Address's regex resources - Apparently, not as easy as it sounds

<https://emailregex.com/>

### IP Address regex

Not 100% valid, as will match all numbers outside of 255-999, but good for a quick win

`grep -E -o "([0-9]{1,3}[\.]){3}[0-9]{1,3}" file.txt`

The valid way of doing it

`grep -E -o "(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.(25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)" file.txt`

## Bash Scripting

### How To Setup Bash IDE

You can see my post at [Full Featured IDE For Bash Scripting](/blog/Full_Featured_IDE_For_Bash_Scripting "ALT TEXT")

### Internal Variables

you can use `printenv` or for shell scripting the following may be useful
<https://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/internalvariables.html>

I also have found the following variables quire useful, and have used them a lot

variable | explanation
----- | -----
` $? ` | Used for capturing the last processes exit code
`$EUID` | Captures the user id that started the script, useful for checking sudo UID 0
`$SUDO_USER` | Captures the username that started a bash script
`$PWD` | present working directory, saves using `$(pwd)`
